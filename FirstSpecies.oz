% My goal is to write an implementation of four-voice strict counterpoint, or
% get as far as possible. I will base my rule set on the counterpoint course I
% have followed this year. At some point I will write up this rule set and my
% interpretation, together with my experiences. But for now, I am going to
% experiment a little.
